Class Chat Rooms
Hi everyone,

In my opinion, the very best part of this course is the active online community we have centered around it. A huge component of that community are the course chatrooms. We now have three different chatrooms for this course, which you can find here:

General Chat  https://gitter.im/Colt/TheWebDeveloperBootcamp
CodeTalk   https://gitter.im/Colt/WDB-CodeTalk
JobTalk   https://gitter.im/Colt/WDB-Jobs
